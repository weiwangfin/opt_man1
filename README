This project is about how an individual will
optimally invest in manipulating activities
to benefit its future cash flow. 
The entire project is hosted on Github and 
the edit work is conducted purely through
ubuntu system. By focusing on the Ubuntu 
system, it helps me concentrate on deep 
work and accelerate my writing process.
